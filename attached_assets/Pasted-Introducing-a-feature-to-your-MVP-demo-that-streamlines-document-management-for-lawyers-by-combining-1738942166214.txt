Relevant Contract Terms: The AI extracts key terms and important information based on the type of contract. For instance, in a lease agreement, it identifies terms such as rent, duration, and responsibilities of each party.
Law Consideration: The AI is equipped with knowledge of relevant laws and regulations applicable to various types of contracts and jurisdictions. It incorporates this legal context during the analysis to ensure compliance and relevance.
Compilation of Summaries:

Professional Summaries: The AI compiles the extracted insights into a coherent, professional summary. This summary is tailored to highlight the most critical aspects of the documents for legal review.
PDF Compilation: The compiled summary is saved as a PDF document in the platform's database for easy access and sharing.
Organization by Client:

Drag-and-Drop Interface: Lawyers can organize documents into client-specific sections using a simple drag-and-drop interface. This feature allows for intuitive and efficient document management, ensuring that all materials are easily accessible and well-organized.
User Interface:

Clean and Modern Design: The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, with a focus on simplicity and ease of navigation. It is tailored to cater to lawyers who may have varying levels of technical proficiency.
Customization Options: Lawyers have the ability to customize document categorizations, overriding AI suggestions where necessary, ensuring flexibility and accuracy in document organization.
Security and Compliance:

Data Protection: The platform incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive legal documents. It ensures compliance with data protection laws such as GDPR.
User Authentication: Access to the platform and documents is secured through user authentication protocols, enhancing privacy and security.
Testing and Feedback:

Continuous Improvement: The system is designed with testing and feedback mechanisms in place to ensure the AI's accuracy in key term extraction and applicable law identification. Regular updates and improvements are planned based on user feedback.
Implementation Strategy:

Upload Process Enhancements: During document upload, lawyers can specify the type of contract and jurisdiction. This information guides the AI in applying the correct legal framework and focusing on relevant key terms.
